# Blueprint Standards

Every Aviatrix Blueprint must meet these standards to ensure consistency, quality, and usability.

## Required README Sections

Each blueprint's README.md must include the following sections:

### 1. Title and Description

```markdown
# Blueprint Name

Brief description of what this blueprint deploys and demonstrates.
One to three sentences covering the use case and the Aviatrix Cloud Native Security Fabric capabilities it showcases (e.g., Distributed Cloud Firewall, workload segmentation, Zero Trust enforcement).
```

### 2. Architecture Diagram

A visual representation of the deployed infrastructure:

```markdown
## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](architecture.png)

Brief explanation of the architecture and data flows.
```

Requirements:
- PNG or SVG format
- Clearly labeled components
- Show network connectivity and Aviatrix components
- Include cloud provider regions/availability zones

### 3. Prerequisites

Link to shared prerequisite docs plus any blueprint-specific requirements:

```markdown
## Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- [Aviatrix Control Plane](../../docs/prerequisites/aviatrix-controller.md) (v7.1+) - Controller and CoPilot
- [Terraform](../../docs/prerequisites/terraform.md) (v1.5+)
- [AWS CLI](../../docs/prerequisites/aws-cli.md)
- [kubectl](../../docs/prerequisites/kubectl.md)

### Required Access
- AWS account with permissions to create VPCs, EKS, EC2, etc.
- Aviatrix Control Plane with AWS account onboarded

### Blueprint-Specific Requirements
- At least 3 available EIPs in the target region
- Service quota for EKS clusters
```

### 4. Resources Created

A table listing all cloud resources that will be created:

```markdown
## Resources Created

| Resource | Description | Quantity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| AWS VPC | Transit and spoke VPCs | 3 |
| Aviatrix Transit Gateway | Primary transit gateway | 1 |
| Aviatrix Spoke Gateway | Spoke gateways for workloads | 2 |
| EKS Cluster | Kubernetes cluster for app workloads | 1 |
| EC2 Instance | Test instances for connectivity validation | 2 |

**Estimated Cost**: ~$X/hour when running (see cost breakdown below)
```

### 5. Deployment Instructions

Step-by-step instructions:

```markdown
## Deployment

### Step 1: Clone and Navigate

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/aviatrix/aviatrix-blueprints.git
cd aviatrix-blueprints/blueprints/<blueprint-name>
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Configure Variables

\`\`\`bash
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
\`\`\`

Edit `terraform.tfvars` with your values:
- `controller_ip`: Your Aviatrix Control Plane (Controller) IP
- ...

### Step 3: Deploy

\`\`\`bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
\`\`\`

Deployment takes approximately X minutes.
```

### 6. Variables Reference

Document all input variables:

```markdown
## Variables

| Variable | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|------|---------|----------|
| controller_ip | Aviatrix Control Plane (Controller) IP address | string | - | yes |
| controller_username | Controller admin username | string | "admin" | no |
| aws_region | AWS region for deployment | string | "us-east-1" | no |
```

### 7. Outputs Reference

Document all outputs:

```markdown
## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| transit_gateway_id | ID of the Aviatrix Transit Gateway |
| spoke_vpc_ids | List of spoke VPC IDs |
| test_instance_ips | Public IPs of test instances |
```

### 8. Test Scenarios / Demo Walkthrough

Provide specific scenarios to validate the deployment:

```markdown
## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: East-West Connectivity

Verify connectivity between spoke VPCs:

\`\`\`bash
# SSH to test instance in Spoke 1
ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@<spoke1-instance-ip>

# Ping test instance in Spoke 2
ping <spoke2-private-ip>
\`\`\`

Expected result: Ping succeeds, traffic flows through Transit Gateway.

### Scenario 2: Firewall Inspection

Verify traffic is inspected by DCF:

1. Open CoPilot > Security > Distributed Cloud Firewall
2. Navigate to Monitor
3. Generate traffic between spokes
4. Verify traffic appears in logs
```

### 9. Cleanup / Destroy

Instructions for complete cleanup:

```markdown
## Cleanup

### Standard Destroy

\`\`\`bash
terraform destroy
\`\`\`

### Manual Cleanup (if destroy fails)

If Terraform destroy fails, manually delete:

1. Any Kubernetes LoadBalancer services (creates AWS ELBs)
2. ...

### Verify Cleanup

Confirm no resources remain:

\`\`\`bash
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --filters "Name=tag:Blueprint,Values=<blueprint-name>"
\`\`\`
```

### 10. Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

```markdown
## Troubleshooting

### Gateway creation fails

**Symptom**: Aviatrix gateway times out during creation

**Solution**:
1. Verify AWS account is onboarded in the Control Plane
2. Check security group allows Controller communication
3. Verify sufficient EIP quota

### EKS nodes not joining

**Symptom**: EKS nodes remain in "NotReady" state

**Solution**:
1. Check node IAM role permissions
2. Verify VPC CNI configuration
3. Review node security group rules
```

### 11. Tested Versions

Document the versions this blueprint is currently tested against:

```markdown
## Tested With

This blueprint is currently tested with:

| Component | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| Aviatrix Controller | 8.0.x |
| Aviatrix Terraform Provider | 3.2.0 |
| Terraform | 1.9.x |
| AWS Provider | 5.80.x |

> **Note**: The blueprint may work with other versions, but these are the versions used for validation.
```

### 12. Changelog (Optional but Recommended)

Include a `CHANGELOG.md` file to track significant changes:

```markdown
